# [YASS](http://lxc-xx.github.io/YASS/)
# Yet Another SDP Solver
YASS is a Semidefinite solver using interior-point method. Currently it has two implementions using Python and C++ respectively. It is aimed to creat a lightweight but fast solver, which can be called from any device running

## Python implementation
Python implementation is based on [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org), which is a popular Python numerical computing package. 

## C++ implementation
C++ implementation is based on [Eigen] (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), a C++ template for linear algebra. Eigen is included in the package. So YASS can be compiled does not depend on any non-standard C++ library. It is easy to compile it at any platform where a standard C++ compiler is available.
