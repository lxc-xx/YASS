{"name":"Yass","tagline":"Yet Another SDP Solver","body":"# YASS\r\n# Yet Another SDP Solver\r\nYASS is a Semidefinite solver using interior-point method. Currently it has two implementions using Python and C++ respectively. It is aimed to creat a lightweight but fast solver, which can be called from any device running\r\n\r\n## Python implementation\r\nPython implementation is based on [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org), which is a popular Python numerical computing package. \r\n\r\n## C++ implementation\r\nC++ implementation is based on [Eigen] (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), a C++ template for linear algebra. Eigen is included in the package. So YASS can be compiled does not depend on any non-standard C++ library. It is easy to compile it at any platform where a standard C++ compiler is available.\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n# Reference\r\n\r\n[1]Freund, Robert M. \"Introduction to semidefinite programming (SDP).\" Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2004).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
